# Home Therapies Anemia Management Algorithm
### Initiation of Epogen
1. If patient has never been on erythropoietin-stimulating agent, initiate EPO when Hgb <10.1 g/dl
2. Start EPO subcutaneously once a week as follows:

|Hgb          |Units              |
| ------------|-------------------|
|<8.0 g/dl     |300 Units per Kg dry weight|
|8.0 - 8.9 g/dl|200 Units per Kg dry weight|
|9.0 - 9.7 g/dl|100 Units per Kg dry weight|
9.8 - 10.0 g/dl|50 Units per Kg dry weight|

3. If patients transfer from hemodialysis:

|Hgb          |Dosage Change              |
| -----------|--------------------|
|10 - 11 g/dl|Decrease present dose by 70% and obtain hemoglobin with admission labs|

### Titrate dose to achieve target hemoglobin of 10 - 11 g/dl

|Hgb        |Dosage Change|
|---|---|
|<= 9.5 g/dl|Increase dose by 50% and contact physician for further order|
|9.5 - 9.9 g/dl|Increase dose by 25%|
|10.0 - 10.3 g/dl|Increase dose by 10%|
|10.4 - 10.7 g/dl|No change in dose.  See 1 below|
|10.8 - 11.1 g/dl|Decrease dose by 10%|
|11.2 - 11.4 g/dl|Decrease dose by 25%|
|>= 11.5 g/dl|Discontinue and recheck hemoglobin in two weeks, then monthly.  See 2 below|

1. If patient has a hemoglobin increase or decrease of 1.5 g/dl or more in one month, modify EPO dose by 10%.
2. After discontinuation, when hemoglobin <= 10.6 g/dl, restart EPO at 25% of last dose.  If patient has been off EPO >= 2 months, use initiation scale.

### Other considerations
1. Dose changes to be made with monthly labs.
2. Doses >120,000 Units per month, document cause of hypo response in progress record.  Evaluate patient for infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, malignancy, dialysis adequacy, protein malnutrition, vitamin deficiency.  EPO dose not to exceed 400,000 Units per month.
3. Contact MD if target hemoglobin goal is not reached in 90 days for further instructions.
4. Round EPO dose down to nearest 1,000 Units.  Round EPO dose UP to the nearest 1,000 Units **ONLY** if a dosage change is indicated and rounding down results in **NO** change.
5. RN to consult with Nephrologists when he/she believes based on assessment of patient's condition, it is not appropriate to follow the algorithm.  Continue current EPO dose until contact with physician is made.
6. If physician orders EPO dose apart from algorithm, resume algorithm following the change.
7. If hemoglobin results appear to be lab error, recheck hemoglobin level immediately. Do not change dose until result can be verified.
8. If hospitalized, adjust EPO dose per last available hemoglobin.
### Laboratory monitoring
1. Prior to starting EPO: CBC, Iron, UIBC, Ferritin, Transferrin Saturation
2. Monthly: CBC, Iron, UIBC, Transferrin Saturation
3. Quarterly: Ferritin
